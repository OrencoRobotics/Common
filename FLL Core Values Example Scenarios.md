## We are a team.

A group of robotics kids are talking at lunch and the new kid, who just joined FLL, sits down to have lunch by himself. A couple members of the robotics team invite the new guy to come sit with them.

There is general disagreement about how to solve a particularly tricky technical problem but each member of the group makes an effort to listen when it's someone else's turn to talk.

All the kids participating in the FLL Robotics competition make an effort to remember their responsibilities and show up looking sharp and wearing their team uniform/colors.

One member of the group is struggling to solve their assigned task so two others pitch in to work with the first and they complete the task together.

The group agrees to have a mascot and they name it Timmy! Whenever they successfully complete a difficult task they always celebrate with Timmy!

## We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.

Team members always ask questions about what certain program blocks do and how they fit together. They never ask the coach to write code.

Whenever there is a difficult program to write the team always tries at least three different approaches before asking for outside help.

An FLL Team likes to brainstorm ideas whenever they have a big problem to solve. Then they share their ideas with their coaches and mentors.

An FLL team worked together to pick a topic they all want to research. They realized is was important for everyone to stay motivated to do the work.

## We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together.

A teammate is working to find an answer to whether or not fluids can ever flow against the force of gravity. She asks her coach for some insight and the coach isn't sure. They decide to look for an answer together.

Coach John is demonstrating a technique for monitoring distances using the ultrasonic sensor. It's been awhile since John has used this approach and fumbles with the code. One of the teammates remembers how to write the code to use the sensor and offers to show everyone. Coach John happily accepts the help.

## We honor the spirit of friendly competition.

Two teams from the same school are competing against each other. One of the teams has problems with their robot and it doesn't get any points. The winning team empathizes and says "Oh man! that's happened to us before!" and offers some words of encouragement.

Two teams from the same school are competing against each other. One of the teams has problems with their robot and it doesn't get any points. The team suffering from the robot problems congratulates the winning team on their success and works as a team to find a solution to the robot's performance.

One of the FLL competing teams are sticking to themselves during their time in the pit instead of learning about the other teams and projects. They don't seem to care who does well and are just going through the motions when it's time for judging.

One of the FLL robotics teams experiences a disaster; their robot is destroyed in a freak laser accident. Unfortunately, there is nothing they can do to recover their hardware and compete. They manage to keep smiles on their faces, show up for all their judging, and cheer on other teams.

## What we discover is more important than what we win.

It's a clean sweep! The FLL team from Orenco wins every trophy and experiences the adulation of the crowd. Later that summer, one of the team members is sharing the story with her distant family. A younger cousin has a new EV3 set and wants to know how to use it. The FLL team member explains she really didn't do the programming part of the competition and doesn't know how to use the software.

The team from Virginia didn't win anything two years in a row and is preparing to compete for the third time. They are totally stoked to get started with this year's event because of all the cool things they get to research and do.

One of the team members is taking a math test and is asked to calculate the diameter of a circle. She remembers from her time in FLL that the circumference is 2πr which she needed to know to calculate how far a certain wheel would travel. Later in her adult life she becomes an astronomer and needs to calculate the circumference of a new earth-like planet. She never won an FLL award but 20 years later she wins a Nobel for her work in physics. 

## We share our experiences with others.

A younger cousin has a new EV3 set and wants to know how to use it. His older cousin, an FLL team member, explains how to use the software and helps him build and program his first robot.

During the course of their research an FLL team learns that a local river is polluted and is harming the native wildlife. As part of their project they devise a campaign to make their fellow citizens aware of the problem. After the competition, they work with the local parks and rec to organize a stream cleanup day.

Two former FLL team members hear that their former school's team is struggling. They decide to volunteer some time to help out.

## We display Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® in everything we do.

Two teams are competing at the tournament table when one team member notices that the robot of the opposing team has a loose data cable. Before the competition timer starts the team member who noticed the issue alerts the other team to the problem.

## We have FUN!

Two FLL team members are overheard in the following conversation,
Jack: Why was the robot angry?
Ben: Beats me.
Jack: Because someone kept pushing his buttons!

Samantha is working on fixing a problem with her team's robot's navigation. After several attempts and numerous failures she finally has the robot working reliably. She starts jumping up and down excitedly with a sense of accomplishment.

Figures on a mat.
Unseen forces controlling.
Nifty little bot.
