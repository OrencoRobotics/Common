## We are a team.

A group of robotics kids are talking at lunch and the new kid, who just joined FLL, sits down to have lunch by himself. A couple members of the robotics team invite the new guy to come sit with them.

There is general disagreement about how to solve a particularly tricky technical problem but each member of the group makes an effort to listen when it's someone else's turn to talk.

All the kids participating in the FLL Robotics competition make an effort to remember their responsibilities and show up looking sharp and wearing their team uniform/colors.

One member of the group is struggling to solve their assigned task so two others pitch in to work with the first and complete the task.

The group agrees to have a mascot and they name it Timmy! Whenever they successfully complete a difficult task they always celebrate with Timmy!

## We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.

Team members always ask questions about what certain program blocks do and how they fit together. They never ask the coach to write code.

Whenever there is a difficult program to write the team always tries at least three different approaches before asking for outside help.

We brainstorm ideas whenever we have a big problem to solve. Then we share our ideas with our coaches and mentors.


## We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together.
## We honor the spirit of friendly competition.
## What we discover is more important than what we win.
## We share our experiences with others.
## We display Gracious Professionalism® and Coopertition® in everything we do.
## We have FUN!
