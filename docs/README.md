>I find that our group tends to try to build things that are not strong and reliable.
>
>I think we can get better at this by following a few simple rules:
>
>1) try to build things that look like real world machines
>2) build things using squares and square pieces
>3) when making something rotate, use at least two pivot points or two points of rotation
>4) use at least two points of attachment for all pieces
>5) make things that are easy to add and remove to the base robot
